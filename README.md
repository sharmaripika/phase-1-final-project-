#Vegan Recipe Search and Favorites Web Application
This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes and add them to a favorites list. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, while a local JSON server is used to mock a backend API for recipe data.

##Features
Search Recipes: Users can click the search button to fetch recipes from a local API (http://localhost:3000/recipes).
Display Recipes: Fetched recipes are displayed with their names, ingredients, and instructions.
Add to Favorites: Each recipe in the search results can be added to a favorites list by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button.
Remove from Favorites: Recipes in the favorites list can be removed by double-clicking the "Remove" button.
Toggle Favorite: Recipes in the favorites list can be toggled between a white heart (not liked) and a red heart (liked).
